# PostgreSQL Exercises

Welcome to **PostgreSQL Exercises**! This repository contains solutions to a series of SQL exercises built around a simple dataset. The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to learn PostgreSQL by solving practical, real-world problems through exercises.

## About the Project

This project was created because, while there's plenty of material to learn SQL, it can be challenging to find exercises that focus on hands-on learning. PGExercises provides a collection of problems and explanations, using a single dataset to ensure consistency and simplicity throughout the exercises.

The exercises range in difficulty, starting from simple `SELECT` queries and `WHERE` clauses, to more advanced topics like joins, `CASE` statements, aggregations, window functions, and recursive queries. These exercises are suitable for anyone learning SQL, whether you're a beginner or want to challenge yourself with more advanced queries.

## Features

- **Simple Dataset**: All exercises are based on a single, straightforward dataset, which allows for a focus on SQL queries rather than complex schema design.
- **Variety of Exercises**: The exercises cover a wide range of SQL topics, including:
  - Basic queries
  - Aggregation functions
  - Joins
  - Subqueries and recursive queries
  - Window functions
- **Practical Use**: This repository serves as a great resource for learning and improving your SQL skills by solving real-world problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/namansethi1/POSTGRESQL-Exercise-Alisdair-Owens-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd POSTGRESQL-Exercise-Alisdair-Owens
   ```

3. You can then open and execute each SQL file in your preferred PostgreSQL environment to test and verify your solutions.

## Project Structure

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts, each solving a specific exercise problem. The structure is as follows:

```
/PostgreSQL-Exercise-Alisdair-Owens
    /Aggregation
        - 1 Count the number of facilities.sql
        - 10 Find facilities with a total revenue less than 1000.sql
        - 11 Output the facility id that has the highest number of slots booked.sql
        - 12 List the total slots booked per facility per month.sql
    ...
```

Each file is named according to the exercise it solves, and includes the SQL query to solve the problem.
